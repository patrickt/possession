- Roguelike
- Copying ToME 2's "Lost Soul Deathmold" run
  - You can't move directly, you can only teleport
  - Accurately (to a new level), or inaccurately (to a nearby space)
  - Gameplay loop involves room-jumping until you find something that can help you
  - Or an enemy you can kill for XP, and then possess
