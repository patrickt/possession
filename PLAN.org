- Roguelike

Brick event loop (EventM)

  - Can write to BChan (redraw, trigger UI)

We can't blit vty images directly, there's no superimpose operation
I don't want to write the various gyrations required to figure that out
So we could make an Array of Vty images, and each Located thing writes
into the array. We can do that iteratively or foldmapily. Then we can
build scanlines with horizJoin and join the scanlines with vertJoin.
