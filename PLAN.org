- Roguelike
- Copying ToME 2's "Lost Soul Deathmold" run
  - You can't move directly, you can only teleport
  - Accurately (to a new level), or inaccurately (to a nearby space)
  - Gameplay loop involves room-jumping until you find something that can help you
  - Or an enemy you can kill for XP, and then possess

Brick event loop (EventM)
  Reads from keyboard
  Can read from BChan
  Can write to WChan

Apecs event loop
  - Can write to BChan (redraw, trigger UI)
  - Can read from WChan (tick)
  - Runs in IO

We can't blit vty images directly, there's no superimpose operation
I don't want to write the various gyrations required to figure that out
So we could make an Array of Vty images, and each Located thing writes
into the array. We can do that iteratively or foldmapily. Then we can
build scanlines with horizJoin and join the scanlines with vertJoin.
