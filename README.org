* Hello

This is a little roguelike made for fun.

It is unconventional in terms of its implementation, being a fused-effects application working atop the Apecs ECS, reading configuration via Dhall.

For future directions and technical details, see ~PLAN.org~ in this directory.

* Code organization

This follows the following module hierarchy:
- ~Data~ - for generic data structures unspecific to core game logic, used in ~Game~ and ~UI~
- ~Game~ - data structures involved in the ECS and its care & feeding
- ~UI~ - Brick-specific code (will eventually be an OpenGL frontend or something)
